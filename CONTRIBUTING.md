April 2024 update:

As of late, I haven't had a lot of time to work on this extension. There are some small issues, but
on most systems, the extension works well and does what it's supposed to do. I therefore consider
this extension feature complete and will likely no longer either implement or merge feature
requests. This extension has remained largely ever since I released it almost three years ago, and
I consider stability of the existing feature set more important than anything else.

Due to its very nature, this extension relies heavily on bash scripts, which means it's hard to test
and challenging to not regress when adding new functionality, which again can explain my reluctance
to consider additional features at this point.

Please feel free to report and fix issues, though. It may take time before I can get around to
reviewing or fixing them.
