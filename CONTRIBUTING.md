Thanks for reading this and showing interest! Feel free to submit small patches. Please document how
you tested these, and what additional testing you recommend to be performed.

For larger changes, it's perhaps a good idea to touch base first. Currently, this is a one-person
project, and the time I can dedicate to this extension is limited. Therefore, I'm less inclined to
review and merge changes that:
- are hard to review
- add scope creep
- refactor large amounts of code
- anything else that takes a lot of time to guarantee that nothing breaks

That said, I'm not necessarily opposed to larger changes. It's just a good idea to discuss first.
