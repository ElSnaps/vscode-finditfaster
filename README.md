# FindItFaster
Find it, but faster.

## Features
This plugin is useful if you deal with very large projects with lots of files (which makes VS Code slow), or when
you simply love using `fzf` and `rg`.

1. Use `fzf` to find and open files in your project
2. Use `rg` to find text inside files in your project (and open them!)

## Requirements

This plugin opens a terminal. Make sure that you can run `fzf` and `rg` by running those commands directly.
If that works, this plugin will work.

## Extension Settings

See the GUI settings.

## Known Issues

See the GUI settings. Things are as good as they can be, but VS Code has limited API functionality around
how we can manage the terminal panel.

## Release Notes

### 0.0.1
You gotta start somewhere!
